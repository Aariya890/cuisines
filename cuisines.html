<i>Hello. I am going to introduce about my country's cuisines.</i> <br><br><br>
Bangladeshi cuisine has been shaped by the region's history and river-line geography. Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate. The staple of Bangladesh is rice and fish. The majority of Bangladeshi people are ethnic Bengali, accustomed to Bengali cuisine, with a minority of non-Bengalis, many used to cuisines from different traditions and regions.

<h2><b>History</b></h2>
Bangladeshi culinary habits were strongly influenced by the cuisine of the area's Mughal rulers. This includes rich, aromatic dishes such as biriyani and korma that require the use of a large array of spices along with a great deal of ghee. Dhaka was the Mughal capital of the Bengal Subah and a major trading center in South Asia. Traders, immigrants and visitors brought culinary styles from around the world, which influenced the city's cuisine. After Dhaka became the capital of East Bengal, Persian, Turkish and Arabic-influenced dishes became popular. Black pepper and chui jhal were used to add spiciness before chili was introduced from the Americas. <br><br>
